ABSTRACT
This project aims to develop a linear regression model to predict house prices based on various 
features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and other relevant factors. The model 
will be trained on a dataset containing information about houses sold in a particular area over a certain 
period. The data will be preprocessed and analyzed to identify patterns and relationships between 
different variables. The linear regression model will be built using a subset of the most relevant 
features, selected through feature selection techniques such as correlation analysis and stepwise 
regression. The performance of the model will be evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error, 
R-squared, and root mean squared error. Finally, the model will be deployed as a web application to 
allow users to input house features and get a predicted price. This project will provide valuable 
insights for homebuyers, real estate agents, and property investors, helping them make informed 
decisions based on accurate price predictions.
